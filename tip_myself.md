# Tips for myself

> tips I got during @KB Group and @Graph Group.

### Presentation

- Crystal clear about **Problem Definition**.
- A **simple example** of problem is necessary for presenation.
- The **shortcomings(fundmental issues)** of existing methods, how bad the problem would be under what kind of situation.
- Initial result is needed in PPT, at least some **coding**, don't make this just hand-waiving.


### Methodology

- A working implementation is needed first, then optimize it, don't consider many solutions first and even worse got stuck.
- Three Prospectives: Problem, Algorithm, Data; if a work wanted, try formulate and improve it in these three.
